Open Exoplanet Catalogue - Web Front End
========================================

This repository contains a web front end for the [Open Exoplanet Catalogue](https://github.com/hannorein/open_exoplanet_catalogue). It uses python, [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) and [jinja2](http://jinja2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to format the contents of the Open Exoplanet Catalogue.

The Open Exoplanet Catalogue is a database of all discovered extra-solar planets. New planets are usually added within 24 hours of their announcement. The Open Exoplanet Catalogue and this front end are licensed under an MIT license (see below), which basically says you can do everything with it. If you use either of them for a scientific publication, please include a reference to the Open Exoplanet Catalogue on [github](https://github.com/hannorein/open_exoplanet_catalogue) or to [this arXiv paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.7121).
